<h1>My Pets</h1> <!--this is biggest header becuase it is the main title that needs to stand out-->
    
<h3>I have three different pets, and they are all my favorite for different reasons. I feed them and give them water every day, and even though it's a lot of work, they are totally worth it. </h3> <!--I made this header a little smaller so that it is not as big as the main title-->
<br>
<h3>Lula, the dog</h3> <!--this will be the header number for all the names of the pets and what species it is-->
<p>Lula's been my dog for two years, and she's really fun to play with.  I like to take her to the park.  Her favorite toy is an old tennis ball.</p> <!--the p tag will differentiate the intros of the pets for the users-->

<h3>Slowpoke, the turtle</h3>
<p>Slowpoke is my turtle.  I have had him for as long as I can remember, but he became mine for real when I turned 10 because I promised to take care of him.</p>

<h3>Hamster, the fish</h3>
<p>Hamster is the name of my fish.  I named him hamster because I wanted a hamster and not a fish, but I like him anyway.  He basically just swims around all day, but I still like him.</p>
